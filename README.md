# SecP â€” Secure Protocol of the Damnedâ„¢

A modular, paranoid, zero-compromise secure messaging protocol. Built from scratch with VS Code, TweetNaCl, TypeScript, and existential distrust.

## ðŸ”¥ Core Principles

- **Key-only identity** â€” no phone numbers, emails, or weak-ass usernames
- **Admin-enforced session policy** â€” accept the config or get kicked and wiped
- **No message restore** â€” you opt out, you lose everything. Permanently.
- **Metadata resistance** â€” mixnets, sealed sender, and cover traffic incoming
- **Multi-device restrictions** â€” optional, strict, and always user-controlled
- **Transport agnostic** â€” relay, mixnet, p2pâ€”whatever hell you want to route it through

## ðŸš§ Roadmap

### âœ… Implemented
- Identity generation + signature binding (ed25519)
- Session config signing + verification
- Canonical JSON serialization for hash stability
- Policy-bound session negotiation
- Encrypted message envelopes (NaCl box.before)
- Detached message signature + verification

### ðŸ”œ Next Up
- [ ] Group chat enforcement (join, opt-in, kick-on-decline)
- [ ] Multi-device session sync + device key binding
- [ ] Config update propagation + opt-out purge
- [ ] Mixnet-capable routing layer (decoy traffic, sealed sender)
- [ ] Key-only contact exchange + discovery
- [ ] Replay protection, nonce reuse prevention

### ðŸ§ª Possible Experiments
- [ ] Post-quantum fallback (Kyber encapsulation swap-in)
- [ ] Pluggable transport modules (Tor, I2P, Bluetooth relays?)
- [ ] One-time key preloading (X3DH-style ratchet bootstrap)

## ðŸ’£ No Compromise Mode

This protocol is not here to hold your hand or forgive your mistakes.

- Decline a config update? You're out.
- Lost your key? You're fucked.
- Want to restore history? LOL no.
- This protocol respects freedom, not convenience.

MIT â€” use it, break it, fork it, just donâ€™t blame us when it actually works.
